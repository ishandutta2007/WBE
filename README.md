### SLOWED DOWN MOORES LAW(36 months doubling)(most pessimistic case)
|   |2020 |    |2030 |   | 2040 |  | 2050 
| ------------- |:----------- |:--------------:| -----:| ------------- |:----------- |:--------------:| -----:| 
| Scanning(100 Beam SEM x 1M units) |$1T |Scanning(10K Beam SEM x 10K units) |$10B |Scanning(1M Beam SEM x 100 units) |$100M |Scanning(100M Beam SEM) |$1M |

| Total |$1130.02B |Total |$13.012B |Total |$411.2M |Total |**$52.11M** |


- From the above table we can see by **2040** the unit cost is estimated to be between **$111.005M and $411.2M**, and by **2050** the unit cost is estimated to be between **$2.11M and $52.11M**.
- It is also to be noted that SEM improvements may follow Wrights Law in long term instead of Moores Law. This analysis uses original Moores law for SEM in all the above four cases as in recent past SEM improvements have been moving at par with original moores law if not faster. But beyond 2040 if it slows down the 2050 estimates might get pushed to 2060.
- The R&D cost is estimated as averaging of the total R&D cost divided by total potential customers who can afford that price range(and aslso wish to opt for it). The total R&D from government and philanthropic foundations in neuroscience in 2020-2050 period is expected to be of the order of $100B. And as the industry matures private sector is expected to deploy capital of the order of $10B. We estimate potential customers in 2040-2049 is order of 1k and 2050-2059 is oder of 100k. So averaging R&D per customer for 2040s comes as $10M and for 2050s as $100K.
